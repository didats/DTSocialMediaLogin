Handle iOS app login with Sign in with Apple, Twitter, Facebook and Google with ease. It will really saves you a lot of hours. The callback will give you these variables:

* id (`String`)
* name (`String`)
* email (`String`)
* profileImageURL (`String`)
* origin (`Any`)

The origin is a reference to the struct `DTAppleUser`, `DTGoogleUser`, `DTFacebookUser` and `DTTwitterUser`. For Google it has the property `user` that reference to `GIDGoogleUser` which you could use for any other Google APIs. While for Twitter, it has an `OAuthToken` to be use on other Twitter APIs.

## Requirements
* Base SDK: iOS 12
* Deployment Target: iOS 10.0 or greater

## Installation with Cocoapods

Add pod to your Podfile.
```
pod 'DTSocialMediaLogin'
```

Open your `AppDelegate.swift` file, and add these codes
```swift
// add import line
import DTSocialMediaLogin
...
...
...
// add openURL method
func  application(_ app:  UIApplication, open url:  URL, options:  [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey  :  Any]  =  [:])  ->  Bool  {
	return  DTSocialMediaLogin.openURL(app: app, url: url, options: options) 
}
```

### Implementing Google Sign In
Get the `Google Client ID` and `Scheme Path URL` from [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). You may follow the tutorial at [Google Sign In](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/) to get those. Put your `Scheme Path URL` to the `URL Scheme` configuration on Xcode.

### Implementing Facebook Login
Setup an app on [Facebook Developer Portal](https://facebook.com/developer), and get the `Facebook App ID`. Put your `App ID` on the `Info.plist` file:
```
<key>FacebookAppID</key>
<string>0123456789</string>
```

Put `fb-your-fb-app-id-` on `URL Scheme`. If your App ID is 123, then `fb123` need to be on your `URL Scheme`. Put the `fbauth2` on your `URL Scheme` as well.

### Implementing Twitter Login
Go to [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/) and get `Twitter App Key` and `Twitter App Secret`. Put the `dttwitter-your-appkey-` to URL Scheme. If your app key is `1212` the put `dttwitter-1212`.

### Implementing Login with Apple
On XCode, go to `Signing & Capabilities` tab. Enable `Sign In with Apple` there.

### Code implementation
On your Login View Controller, or whereever you wanna put the Login button, add import at the top and declare a property
```swift
import DTSocialMediaLogin

class LoginViewController: UIViewController {
	var socialLogin: DTSocialMediaLogin!
```

On your `viewDidLoad` method, add the initialization. Fill the string with empty if you do not need them.

```swift
let settings =  DTSocialMediaKeys(
			googleClientID:  "_google_client_id_", 
			facebookID:  "_faceebook_id_", 
			twitterAppKey:  "_twitter_api_key_", 
			twitterAppSecret:  "_twitter_secret_key_") 
socialLogin =  DTSocialMediaLogin.setup(settings: settings)
```

And on your login button action, specify with the code:
```swift
@objc  func  didButtonClick(_ sender:  UIButton)  {
	socialLogin.login(with:  .Facebook,  from: viewController)  {  error, user  in  
		// you will get the user detail on variable user  
		// user.name, user.email, user.id, user.profileImageURL  
	}  
}
```

That's all!
